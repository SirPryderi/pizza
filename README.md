# Introduction
I have been asked way too many times how Italians make pizza. I was doing my own version of pizza at the beginning, using wholemeal flour and whatnot, until I started trying various recipes. This guide is the result of months of trials and errors. 

The truth about making pizza is that it's quite easy, it's all about the quality of the ingredients you use.
Don't be afraid to go a little bit expensive when it comes to toppings. Making the base is dead cheap anyways.

# That's what you'll need
Let's jump into something more practical! The ingredients here should be enough to make 6 medium/small Margherita pizzas.

## The base
- White flour (800-1000 g)
- Water (500 ml)
- Salt (25 g)
- Olive oil (25 g)
- Sugar (10 g)
- Yeast, either:
    - Powder (~1 spoon)
    - Fresh Yeast (???)

## Toppings
- Chopped Tomatoes in sauce (800 g)
- 2 Mozzarella (2 x ~125 g)
- Fresh Basil 
- Salt

# The makings

## The Dough
One of the most important aspect with the making of pizza dough is that the amount of flour used is not the same, it varies according to factors like the type of water, humidity and temperature. What is directly proportional to the number of pizza you want to make is water (~100 ml for each pizza).

Take a large bowl. Add around the half of the expected amount of flour (400g for 6 pizzas), powder yeast and sugar. Mix it with a spoon, and move everything in one half of the bowl. Pour water in the remaining half and dilute the salt. Now mix water and flour with a spoon.

Keep working until the mix is even and start adding flour. Keep blending with a spoon until it's possible. At this point use your hands, and pull a side of the dough on top and push. If you want, you can use a counter instead of the bowl now. Keep doing this while adding more flour till the dough stops being sticky. The process should last around 20 minutes. 

Once the dough is perfectly even, non sticky, but still elastic, you can let it rest for 30 minutes, covering the bowl with cling film.

## The Rising
After the dough has rested, bring it to a surface, and cut it in half with a knife. Roll the two halves until they look like a baguette (lol), and using your thumb and index to squeeze it, separate three small balls. Work them with your hands till they are round. You should have 6 small(ish) dough balls in total. You can use a scale to weigh them exactly, if you don't trust your pizza-maker instinct! 

Position the dough balls in a surface, preferably covered, and let them rise for at least 6 hours. Leave enough space between them, or they will merge at some point during the rising.
