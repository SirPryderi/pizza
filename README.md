# Introduction
I have been asked a lot of times by many of my non-Italian friends what's the recipe for the pizza I make, but I struggle to find a good general guide on how to make authentic home-made pizza that is written in English, so I decided to write my own. I'm wonderful, I know.

> No!
> Try not!
> Dough or dough not.
> There's no try.

In truth, making pizza is quite easy, you just need to follow a few simple guidelines and source good quality ingredients.
Do not be afraid to go a little bit more expensive when it comes to the ingredients.

# Ingredients
Let's jump to something more practical! The ingredients here should be enough to make 5 medium/small Margherita pizzas. See [this handy table](./proportions.md) instead of the section below, if you want to make a different amount of pizzas.

## The base
- White flour (800-1000 g)
- Water (500 ml)
- Salt (25 g)
- Olive oil (25 g)
- Sugar (10 g)
- Yeast, either:
    - Powder (~1 spoon)
    - Fresh Yeast (???)

> ðŸ’¡ The flour type should be what in Italy is called _00_, but this categorization is not used elsewhere. General purpose white flour will do, but if you can find the [_Caputo Pizzeria_ flour](https://www.mulinocaputo.it/en/flour/la-linea-professionale/pizzeria) that's your preferred choice.

## Toppings
These are the toppings needed for Margherita pizzas. See below for other pizza types.

- Finely chopped tomatoes (_polpa di pomodoro_) in sauce (800 g);
- 2 mozzarella (2 x ~125 g)
- Fresh basil (a handful)
- (Optional) Oregano (a pinch)

> ðŸ’¡ The choice of tomato sauce is quite important. I prefer not to use _passata_ as it changes the taste slightly. I recommend [Mutti Polpa](https://mutti-parma.com/en/products/polpa/) if you can find it.
# The makings

## The Dough
One of the most important aspect with the making of pizza dough is that the amount of flour used is not always the same, it varies according to factors like flour, water, temperature, etc. 

The amount of water is constant and directly proportional to the number of pizzas you want to make (~100 ml for each pizza).

1. Take a large bowl. 
2. Add around the half of the expected amount of flour ([see proportions]((./proportions.md))), powder yeast, and sugar. 
3. Mix it with a spoon, and move everything in one half of the bowl. 
4. Pour water in the remaining half and dilute the salt. 
5. Now mix water and flour with a spoon.
6. Add the olive oil to the mix.
7. Start working the dough with your hands.

You should pull a side of the dough, fold it on top and push it down. Continue doing this while adding more flower to the bottom when it gets sticky.

If you want, you can use a counter instead of the bowl now.

Continue with the process until the dough is smooth, elastic and does not stick anymore. The process should last around 20-30 minutes.

Cover the bowl with cling film, and let the dough rest in it for 30 minutes, 

## The Rising
After the dough has rested:
1. Take it to a working surface, and cut it in half with a knife. 
2. Roll the two halves until they look like a baguette. 
3. Using your thumb and index to squeeze it, separate three equal balls (around 250 g each).
4. Work them with your hands until they are round.

You should have 1 dough balls for each pizza. You can use a scale to weigh them exactly â€“ and if you don't just trust your pizza-maker instincts!

Position the dough balls on a surface, preferably covered, and let them rise for at least 6 hours.

Leave enough space between them, or they will merge at some point during the rising.

## The Tomato Sauce
To prepare the tomato sauce:
1. Fill a bowl with a can of tomato
2. Add a pinch of salt
3. Add a bit of oil
4. Add a few leaves of basil
5. Optionally, a pinch of oregano
6. Mix everything

> ðŸ’¡ If tomato sauce is too watery, you could cook it it a sauce pan until it's a bit more solid.

# Types of Pizzas
When making pizza imagination is the only limit. In Italy, however, there are some named and widespread toppings combinations. I'll list the most famous (and infamous) here, along with an English translation of the name â€“ or at least my best attempt at such.

### Marinara - The Sailor's
Tomato sauce, oregano, minced garlic and oil.

### Margherita - Daisy
Tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil and oil.

### Diavola - The Devil's
Tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami, chili powder, black olives, minced sausages and oil.

### Boscaiola - The Lumberjack's
Mozzarella, mushrooms and minced sausages.

### Capricciosa - The Whimsical's
Tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, sliced eggs, prosciutto and oil.

### Rucola e Proscitutto Crudo - Rocket and Ham
Tomato sauce, rocket, prosciutto crudo (dry-cured ham), and parmesan scales.

### Quattro Formaggi - Four Cheeses

### Quattro Stagioni - Four Seasons
*Coming soon*

### Ortolana - The Gardener's
*Coming soon*

### Wusterl e Patatine - German Sausages and French Fries
Tomato sauce (optional), mozzarella (optional), sliced German sausages, and French fries.

## Variations
1. For a slightly different taste, you could try swapping the normal mozzarella with _mozzarella di bufala_ (buffalo mozzarella).
2. Instead of using finely chopped tomatoes, try using _San Marzano_ tomatoes.
3. Try using _ricotta_ with some of the recipes. It goes well with cured meats and eggplants.
4. Experiment with and without oregano in the tomato sauce.
